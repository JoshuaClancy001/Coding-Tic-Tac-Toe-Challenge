How to make the board?
-Nested for loop printing - Wont work because i can't change them once they are set
-nested for loop with a 2D array( Works!)

How to keep the game going if they want to play again
-while loop on condition that the player wants to keep playing, the boolean variable remains true. Ask the user at the end of the game if they want to keep playing and if they do keep the variable to true if they don't set it to false
I could run into the problem of the board not clearing if they choose to start again
-if the game ends and they choose to play again, clear it using a nested for loop

How to end the game? 
-put it in a while loop and make a variable boolean that tells whether or not 3 in a row has occurred 

How to make it so there is no overwriting 
-Have if statements that don't allow the user to place a mark if there is already one there


I spent the whole 4 hours on it.

If I had more time

-Couldn't figure out how to get it to circle back to the original prompt of asking who the user wants to go first. Thinking it has something to do with it not breaking out of the while loop just could find the correct blace to put the break statement 
-Wasnt able to account for an instance with a tie because I spent a lot of time trying to get the game to replay. If I had more time though, I would create if statements that would determine if all the spaces were filled and then, if they were, print that there had been a tie
